# Whoopsie Derpies NFT - Solidity, Hardhat, React

This is an independent project to showcase familiarity with the Ethereum ecosystem, including Solidity, the Hardhat development environment, and oracles. The website frontend was developed using React.

Whoopsie Derpies is an NFT art collection deployed to the Ethereum <strong>Rinkeby</strong> testnet. Inspired by drawing animals for our twin toddlers whilst getting bumped around and receiving conflicting requests. The animals are cute and just a little bit derpy.

A total of 500 Whoopsie Derpies can be minted on-chain. There are 20 unique animals that are possible to mint: Beaver, Bunny, Cat, Cheetah, Elephant, Flamingo, Fox, Giraffe, Hedgehog, Horse, Lemur, Llama, Narwhal, Octopus, Orca, Pig, Rhino, Sandpiper, Shark, and Squirrel.

The specific animal you mint is determined during the minting process, using Chainlink's VRF to introduce randomness.

Front end currently deployed to netlify at https://whoopsiederpies.netlify.app/.

### Features & Design

#### Frontend

- React Framework for frontend build.
- Bulma.io CSS framework
- ethers.js library for interacting with Ethereum.
- Error handling and notifications to help the user navigate the wait-times associated with blockchains and oracles.

#### Smart Contract

- Contract written in Solidity.
- Contract follows the ERC721 Non-Fungible Token Standard.
- Inherits from OpenZeppelin's ERC721Enumerable and Ownable interfaces.
- Inherits from Chainlink's VRFConsumerBase to obtain verifiable random numbers on-chain and assign a random animal with the result.
- Metadata and images are stored on IPFS and pinned using Pinata.
- Hardhat development environment used for compiling, testing, and deployment.

### TODOS

#### Frontend

- [ ] Listen for `MintedDerpie` contract event in frontend `mintDerpie` function to know when the Chainlink VRF has responded with randomness. Currently I wait 5 minutes using frontend function `waitForChainlinkVRF` before attempting to show the user their newly minted Derpie.
- [x] reduce image file sizes for faster loading.

#### Smart Contract

- [ ] For next solidity contract: add additional logic in hardhat files for easier deployment to different networks (testnets vs localhost vs mainnet etc...)

# Setup

Run `npm install` in the following directories:

- `frontend-react`
- `smart-contract-hardhat`

Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and update with your values as follows:

- smart-contract-hardhat:
  - name of your erc721 token
  - symbol of your erc721 token
  - base uri of your erc721 token
  - eth price of your erc721 token
  - link token rinkeby address
  - chainlink vrfCoordinator rinkeby address
  - chainlik vrfCoordinator rinkeby keyhash
  - chainlik vrfCoordinator rinkeby fee
  - infura url
  - private key
  - etherscan api key
- frontend-react:

  - address of your derpies contract deployed to hardhat localhost
  - address of your VRFCoorinatorMock contract deployed to hardhat localhost
  - address of your derpies contract deployed to rinkeby testnet

# Development

### Smart Contract

Deploy smart contract to a localhost hardhat network:

```
cd smart-contract-hardhat
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy_localhost.js --network localhost
```

### Frontend React App

Start frontend with react-app

```
cd frontend-react
npm run start
```

Make sure to use the correct `DERPIES_ADDRESS` variable in `App.js` for development:

- Comment out `DERPIES_ADDRESS = process.env.REACT_APP_DERPIES_ADDRESS_RINKEBY;`
- Uncomment `const DERPIES_ADDRESS = process.env.REACT_APP_DERPIES_ADDRESS_LOCALHOST;`

# Deployment

### Smart Contract

Smart contract deployed to the Ethereum Rinkeby testnet at contract address 0xFae806Ef5fDadCBa0db4716228EC625d1FC64196. View verified contract at https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0xFae806Ef5fDadCBa0db4716228EC625d1FC64196

Deploy smart contract to the ethereum rinkeby testnet:

```
cd smart-contract-hardhat
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy_rinkeby.js --network rinkeby
```

### Frontend

Front end currently deployed to netlify at https://whoopsiederpies.netlify.app/.

Make sure to use the correct `DERPIES_ADDRESS` variable in `App.js` for deployment:

- Comment out `const DERPIES_ADDRESS = process.env.REACT_APP_DERPIES_ADDRESS_LOCALHOST;`
- Uncomment `DERPIES_ADDRESS = process.env.REACT_APP_DERPIES_ADDRESS_RINKEBY;`

Build the frontend for production with `npm run build`. Deploy the `build` folder.
